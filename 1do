Dear Team,

We recently observed a sudden spike in CPU utilization on one of our production servers. Due to this spike, the server went into a hung state, and we were unable to execute any commands. As a result, we had to reboot the server from the console.

Post reboot, the Cognos server was up and accessible. Upon reviewing the SAR command output, we identified that CPU utilization had suddenly increased due to system-related processes, with the last recorded system CPU usage reaching 69.25%.

We have shared the SAR command output and SOSREPORT with the Red Hat support team and raised a support case (Case Number: 04363273).

As per Red Hat’s initial analysis:

* Multiple soft lockups were observed in the /var/log/messages file.
* A soft lockup commonly occurs when the hypervisor does not schedule virtual CPUs in a timely manner.
* We have been advised to engage the hypervisor vendor to verify whether the host/hypervisor is overloaded and to address any resource contention accordingly.

In case of recurrence, we attempted to capture VMCORE logs by manually enabling the kernel.softlockup_panic parameter to trigger a panic during soft lockup events. However, when the server enters a hung state, we are unable to access it or execute any commands.

As per recommendations, we also configured automatic VMCORE generation via settings.conf, but the server does not transition into panic mode during the issue, and therefore VMCORE is not being generated.

Currently, we are coordinating with the hypervisor team to review system CPU scheduling and host resource allocation. Based on their findings, we will proceed with further troubleshooting steps.

Please let us know if any additional information is required.

Regards,
Adarsh Shinde
