💡 ANSWER:
Based on the provided data, I can answer your question as follows:

**Answer:** No servers have uptime less than 2 weeks.

**Specific differences or issues found:** Since there are only 2 to                                                                    tal servers, it's not possible for any of them to have an uptime le                                                                    ss than 2 weeks. The data doesn't indicate any specific issues with                                                                     server performance or downtime.

**Key statistics or patterns:** Not applicable in this case since t                                                                    here is no relevant data available.

**Actionable insights:** Since all servers have an uptime greater t                                                                    han or equal to 2 weeks, it's likely that the system is functioning                                                                     well overall.

❓ QUESTION: which server is above 40 % cpu usage

🔧 SQL USED: SELECT * FROM `EISHome_compliance` WHERE `cpu` > 40;

⏱️ TIME TAKEN: 66.32 seconds

💡 ANSWER:
Based on the provided system compliance data, I can answer your que                                                                    stion:

**Which server is above 40% CPU usage?**

According to the "cpu" field analysis, there are no servers with CP                                                                    U usage above 40%. The highest CPU usage recorded is 99%, which is                                                                     an outlier. The average CPU usage is 67.86%.

However, if you're looking for servers with high CPU usage (above 2                                                                    0%), I can identify a few:

* Server(s) with CPU usage above 20%: Yes
* Highest CPU usage: 99%
* Average CPU usage: 67.86%

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided data, and a                                                                    ctual server performance may vary.
